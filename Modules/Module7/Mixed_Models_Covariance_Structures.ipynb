    "# Conducting Genetic Evaluations using Mixed Models \n",
    "\n",
    "In this module we will cover the basics of analyzing plant breeding data using mixed models for the purpose of calculating the genetic merit of lines for use as parents commonly referred to as **Estimated Breeding Values (EBV) or Genomic Estimated Breeding Values (GEBV)**. We will only cover 2 examples, but the course will provide some basic information on the sommer package and how to run the analysis using the ILCI JupyterHub Environment. Mixed models are powerful tools for the analysis of breeding data because they can incorporate knowledge of genetic inheritance and genetic control of complex traits, leading to more accurate estimates of genetic merit.\n",

    "**Specifically this module will provide:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A brief review of inheritance, basic principles of quantitative genetics, and response to selection.\n",
    "- An introduction the the mixed model package sommer and instructions on how to fit and interpret results from the sommer package.\n",
    "- Two examples of fitting mixed models using pedigree and genomic relationship matrices.\n",

    "- `mmer()` is the mixed model solver used by sommer. There is also a `mmec()` function for solving mixed models that we will not cover here. For certain types of analysis 'mmec' will run faster.\n",
    "- The first line of the model statement specifies the phenotype and then the fixed effects \"block and variety.\n",
    "- The second line gives the covariance structure for the residuals `rcov= ~units` is the default structure in which residuals are treated as being identically and indepenedently distributed. When using the default structure this line can be omitted, but there are many ways in which the residual covariance can be modeled and I prefer to always explicitly state the structure I'm using.\n",
    "- The last line tells sommer which data frame to use and I set the verbose flag to TRUE so the **convergence** information is printed to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convergence** - Mixed models must be solved iteratively as you need estimates of the model effects to estimate variance composnents and you need the variance components to estimate the random effects. This means the solver must start by randomly initializing the variance components and interatively update the solutions until cpnvergence has been achieled. Mixed models do not always converge for a variety of reasons, so it is important to first check for model convergence before using and of the model outputs."

    "**What is the purpose of the analysis, and what will the estimates be used for?**\n",
    "* When conducting hypothesis testing it is often best to treat the effects of interest as fixed to facilitate the use of standard statistical tests (i.e. t-test)\n",
    "* When using the estimates to for ranking (i.e. select the top 10% of all varieties to advance) treating the effect as random can improve accuracy as we have seen in the examples used in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do you think prior knowledge on the the statistical distribution will improve accuracy?**\n",
    "* We have seen in this course that the use of prior knowledge relating to genetic relatedness can improve accuracy.\n",
    "* The degree to which knowledge of the statistical distribution of a variable will impact the accuracy of estimates depends on the amount of data we have. When estimating the genetic performance of a variety with 100 plots of data, the impact of the prior knowledge of the distribution would be less than if we only had 2 plots of data.\n",
    "* Think of prior iformation on statistical distributions as a suppliment to observed phenotypic data. The less phenotypic data available, on a specific variety for instance, the more the prior knowledge of the statistical distributoin will impact the estimates.\n",

    "**Is there enough information to accurately estimate the paramerters of the the statistical distribution?**\n",
    "* For effects of interest it is important to have reliable estimates of variance and covariance components for the associated statistical distributions. \n",
    "* If I have an experiment with only two environments, I shouldn't expect to get a good variance component estimate for the distribution of environmental effects. In this case it is probably best treat this effect as fixed assuming you have no prior knowledge of the true value of the variance component and have enough data to estimate as a fixed effect.\n"
